# hurricanes
Program that compiles a list of hurricane events spanning back to 1950 into a GeoPandas DataFrame. The program can then be used to specify a specific hurricane event to plot out the hurricane track of the selected hurricane event into a map of the U.S.  

The files and preliminary instructions to make the charts were provided from DataCamp
